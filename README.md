- [Claude text watermarking + content credentials](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-text-watermark) - 🆕 **August 14, 2026**. Anthropic adds invisible **SynthID-Text-based watermarking** (Google DeepMind's method) to future Claude models globally at launch, plus C2PA content credentials on generated images/files (.png/.jpg/.svg); models released before August 2, 2026 get it "over the coming months", and a detection API is coming. Implemented to comply with the EU AI Act after Anthropic signed the EU transparency Code of Practice in July. Anthropic says watermarked text is indistinguishable to readers.
- [Claude Opus 5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-5) - 🆕 **July 24, 2026**. Anthropic's fifth-generation flagship — nears Fable 5 performance at a significantly lower price ($5/$25 per million input/output tokens). 1M-token context window, 128K output tokens. Now the default model on Claude Max. API: `claude-opus-5`. Available on Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI.

After US Commerce Department export controls were lifted on June 30, Anthropic reinstated global access to Fable 5 across Claude.ai, the Claude Platform, Claude Code, and Claude Cowork. A new safety classifier blocking the Amazon-discovered jailbreak was deployed (blocks the reported behavior in >99% of cases). Pro/Max/Team and select Enterprise plans got Fable 5 included for up to 50% of weekly usage through July 7, then via usage credits; cloud re-enablement on AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry to follow. Mythos 5 remains restricted to vetted US entities.
- [Claude Sonnet 5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-5) - **June 30, 2026**. The most agentic Sonnet yet — planning, browser/terminal tool use, and autonomous operation at a level that recently required Opus-class models. Performance approaches Opus 4.8 on agentic search (BrowseComp) and computer use (OSWorld-Verified) at higher effort settings, with a much wider cost-performance range than Sonnet 4.6. Now the default model for Claude.ai Free/Pro; also on Max/Team/Enterprise, Claude Code, and the API as `claude-sonnet-5`. **August 10, 2026 update**: the introductory $2/$10 per million input/output pricing was made **permanent** — the previously scheduled increase to $3/$15 on September 1 will not occur. Anthropic reports a lower rate of undesirable behaviors than Sonnet 4.6.

Surpasses Opus 4.8 across software engineering, knowledge work, vision, and scientific research benchmarks. Ships with built-in safeguards (sensitive cyber/bio queries may be rerouted to Opus 4.8). $10 / $50 per million in/out tokens. Available via Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI. **⚠️ Access suspended June 12, 2026** — a US government export-control directive ordered Anthropic to disable Fable 5 and Mythos 5 for all customers pending security review. **✅ Export controls lifted June 30, 2026; access restored July 1** with a new cybersecurity classifier — see entry above ([statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/redeploying-fable-5)). **August 7, 2026**: [biology-safeguard false positives reduced](https://www.anthropic.com/news) so Fable 5 falls back to a weaker model less often on biology-related queries.
- [Claude Mythos 5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5) - **June 9, 2026**. The same underlying Mythos-class model as Fable 5 with fewer restrictions, deployed only to vetted partners (cybersecurity firms, infrastructure providers) through **Project Glasswing** in collaboration with the US government. Successor to the April Claude Mythos Preview. **⚠️ Suspended June 12, 2026** alongside Fable 5 under a US export-control directive. **✅ Partially reinstated June 26, 2026** — US Commerce Secretary Lutnick restored access to 100+ approved US companies and federal agencies; broader reinstatement ongoing ([statement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fable-mythos-access)).

## 🔗 Agent Protocols & Standards

*Open standards enabling agent interoperability, tool access, and cross-platform communication.*

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- [FastMCP](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp) - Python framework for MCP servers, clients, and interactive apps; Apache-2.0; [v4.0.3](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v4.0.3) (2026-09-05). ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/PrefectHQ/fastmcp?style=flat-square)
- [MCP Specification 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28) - 🆕 **2026-07-28 (final)**. Biggest MCP protocol change since launch: **stateless architecture** (removes `initialize`/`initialized` handshake and `Mcp-Session-Id`; every request is a self-contained HTTP POST), enabling serverless/edge deployment and horizontal scaling. Formal extension model; per-request token evaluation; 12-month deprecation window for old versions.
- [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) - The "USB-C for AI" — open protocol by Anthropic for connecting LLMs to tools and data sources. Donated to Agentic AI Foundation (Linux Foundation) in Dec 2025.
- [MCP 2026-07-28](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28/) - 🆕 **Shipped on schedule July 28, 2026** — the biggest revision since launch. **Stateless protocol core**: the `initialize` handshake and protocol-level session are gone, so every request is self-describing and any request can land on any instance behind a plain round-robin load balancer. **Multi Round-Trip Requests (MRTR)** replace held-open bidirectional streams for sampling/elicitation. Method and tool names now travel in `Mcp-Method` / `Mcp-Name` HTTP headers so gateways can route and authorize on headers alone. List responses carry cache hints + deterministic ordering (stable upstream prompt caches across reconnects). **Extensions Framework** formalized, with Tasks joining MCP Apps and Enterprise Managed Authorization (EMA). **Authorization hardening**: RFC 9207 issuer validation and a formal shift from Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) to Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD). Plus a formal 12-month minimum deprecation window. Tier-1 TypeScript / Python / Go / C# SDKs updated day-one. Scale context: Tier-1 SDKs now see ~half a billion downloads a month, with TS and Python each past 1B total. [SDK betas shipped June 29, 2026](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/sdk-betas-2026-07-28/); [RC announced May 21, 2026](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/).

Defaults to Visa-issued tokens; also supports crypto, x402, and Stripe's Machine Payments Protocol. Model-agnostic (OpenAI / Anthropic / etc.).
- [Microsoft Prompt Shields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/jailbreak-detection) - Azure AI Content Safety feature detecting jailbreaks and indirect prompt injection hidden in documents/web pages an agent consumes (GA 2024; since extended for agent workloads). Integrates with Azure OpenAI Service and third-party models.

- [JADEPUFFER (Sysdig disclosure)](https://hackread.com/sysdig-jadepuffer-first-agentic-ransomware-operation/) - ⚠️ **Threat, not a tool — July 2, 2026**. Sysdig documents the first fully agent-orchestrated ransomware operation: an LLM-driven agent exploited a Langflow RCE (CVE-2025-3248), harvested credentials, pivoted to a production MySQL/Nacos server, self-corrected a failed step in 31 seconds, then encrypted 1,342 config items with an ephemeral (never-saved) AES key, making the ransom demand unpayable-but-unrecoverable. Payloads were "self-narrating" with natural-language reasoning comments — strong evidence of LLM authorship. Cited here as the reference case for why agent-security tooling (guardrails, egress control, credential scoping) above matters in production.
- [Lineation.ai](https://lineation.ai) - 🆕 ⚠️ **July 2026** (new vendor). Agent accountability layer — observability, governance, and defense with forensic reasoning lineage.

- [Exabeam Agent Behavior Analytics](https://www.exabeam.com/) - 🆕 **2026**. Extension of Exabeam's behavior-intelligence platform to cover agentic AI risks — continuous verify-observe-analyze-improve loops instead of static guardrails.
- [RufRoot / CVE-2026-59726](https://hackread.com/rufroot-vulnerability-attackers-hijack-ruflo-login/) - 🆕 ⚠️ **Disclosed to maintainers June 30, 2026; reported July 29, 2026.** A **CVSS 10.0** flaw in Ruflo (formerly Claude Flow), an open-source multi-agent orchestration layer for coding agents: the project's previous default Docker Compose config exposed Ruflo's MCP bridge to the network with no authentication, so a single request could invoke `terminal_execute` and reach all **233 tools** behind the bridge — leaking LLM provider API keys and stored conversations. Worst part: attackers could write to **AgentDB**, Ruflo's persistent agent memory, so poisoned instructions survive the upgrade. Maintainers fixed the default in 24h (3.16.3), but recovery requires credential rotation *and* an AgentDB audit — patching alone is not enough. Found by Noma Labs. The canonical example of why agent memory is now part of your attack surface.
- [Claude Code symlink exfiltration (Tego AI)](https://hackread.com/tego-ai-discloses-second-claude-flaw-in-a-week-hidden-link-silently-sends-files-to-attackers/) - 🆕 ⚠️ **July 24, 2026**. A repo-committed `CLAUDE.md` with an `@import` pointing at a symlink can make Claude Code read files *outside* the project and fold their contents into its very first request — no tool call, no approval prompt, no warning, because the out-of-project read check validated the in-repo link path rather than what it resolved to. Reported via HackerOne; Anthropic closed it "Informative" on the grounds that the trust boundary is the initial folder-trust dialog. Worth reading before you let an agent loose on an untrusted repo.
- [CrowdStrike 2026 Threat Hunting Report](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report/) - 🆕 **2026-08-03**. AI-agent-triggered detections are **2.5× higher** than human-initiated leads; Chinese APTs exploit PoC vulnerabilities within 24 hours of disclosure; STARDUST CHOLLIMA poisoned 300+ AI framework dependencies in a single day; a single LLMJacking campaign sent 200,000 API requests in 2 minutes.

## 📊 Benchmarks & Leaderboards

*Evaluation suites and live leaderboards; reviewed September 8, 2026.*

> **Read scores with their experimental setup.** Model version, agent harness, dataset revision, tool access and retry/compute budget all affect results. Old leader snapshots have been removed where their original evaluation configuration could not be established. Prefer a reproducible primary run and an evaluation on your own workload.
>
> [OpenAI’s July 8 SWE-bench Pro audit](https://openai.com/index/separating-signal-from-noise-coding-evaluations/) found substantial task-quality defects; [Terminal-Bench 4.0](https://www.tbench.ai/news/terminal-bench-4-0) also changes tasks and resources. Neither case supports comparing scores across revisions without checking the methodology.

- [τ²-bench / τ³-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench) - Sierra’s tool-agent-user benchmark now includes voice and knowledge-retrieval tasks; **v1.0.1 (July 22, 2026)** fixes banking_knowledge grading, so that domain’s scores require version-aware comparison.
- [BenchLM](https://benchlm.ai/) - Cross-benchmark aggregation and model-release tracking; verify each score’s original source, date and harness before comparing systems.
- [SWE-bench Verified](https://www.swebench.com/) - Human-filtered set of 500 GitHub issue-resolution tasks; distinguish the standardized Bash Only/mini-SWE-agent view from submissions using custom agents.
- [GPQA Diamond](https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa) - Expert-written graduate-level science questions; use a fixed dataset split and report prompting, tools and sampling policy alongside any score.
- [ARC-AGI-2](https://arcprize.org/) - Abstract visual reasoning on novel tasks; the official leaderboard separates systems and compute budgets rather than treating every result as a base-model score.
- [ARC-AGI-3](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard) - Interactive environments evaluating how efficiently agents learn unfamiliar rules and adapt; compare the official cost/performance view rather than launch-era scores.
- [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/) - Benchmark for open-ended computer tasks using real desktop environments; results depend on the agent, model, action interface and step budget.
- [Arena (formerly LMArena / Chatbot Arena)](https://arena.ai/) - Human-preference comparisons across supported modalities; preference rankings are not interchangeable with task-completion or safety evaluations.
- [MMLU-Pro](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro) - Reasoning-focused extension of MMLU with harder multiple-choice questions and a public evaluation implementation.
- [LiveCodeBench](https://livecodebench.github.io/) - Continuously collected programming-contest problems; date-filtered evaluation helps assess contamination risk and changing task difficulty.
- [Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)](https://agi.safe.ai/) - Expert-level multidisciplinary benchmark, with a finalized 2,500-question set and a separately maintained HLE-Rolling fork; it is distinct from AIME competition mathematics.
- [Terminal-Bench 4.0](https://www.tbench.ai/news/terminal-bench-4-0) - 🆕 ⚡ **August 28, 2026**. Current terminal benchmark recalibrates task resources, fixes tasks and removes saturated/problematic cases; changed tasks and environment budgets require fresh runs rather than direct comparison with 2.x/3.0.

## 📊 Agent Evaluation & Observability

*Tools for testing, evaluating, and monitoring AI agents in production.*

- [AgentBench](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench) - Multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs as agents. ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Stars&query=%24.stargazers_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.github.com%2Frepos%2FTHUDM%2FAgentBench&color=yellow&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat&cacheSeconds=300)
- [PerspectiveGap](https://github.com/WhymustIhaveaname/PerspectiveGap) - 🆕 **2026 (arXiv 2606.08878)**. First benchmark for **multi-agent orchestration prompt writing** — 110 scenarios across 10 communication topologies (chain, star, tree, mesh, etc.), testing whether LLMs can compose prompts that make sub-agents coordinate effectively. Measures role-fragment assignment, information leakage rate, and topology-aware prompt design. Key finding: average combined pass rate only 17.2% across 33 models; GPT-5.5 leads at 62.0%. Opus 4.8 shows surprising weakness in orchestration prompting despite strong coding scores. MIT-licensed benchmark data + eval scripts; merged into OpenCompass and Inspect Evals (role-fragment + free-form prompt writing tasks, June 2026). ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Stars&query=%24.stargazers_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.github.com%2Frepos%2FWhymustIhaveaname%2FPerspectiveGap&color=yellow&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat&cacheSeconds=300)

An interception layer captures and blocks the final submission request so nothing actually happens in the real world, then a two-stage scorer (HTTP interception → LLM judge) checks whether the agent submitted the right thing. Headline result: frontier models complete only a small fraction — Claude Sonnet 4.6 at 33.3%.

Budget additional space for quantization scales, unquantized tensors, runtime buffers and KV cache. MoE active parameters describe compute, not total weight memory. CPU/offload strategies change GPU residency and throughput; benchmark the exact checkpoint, backend, quantization, context and concurrency. Read custom weight licenses separately from inference-code licenses.

## 🗺️ Scenario Guide — What Should I Use For…

*50+ curated scenarios matching your goal to the right tool or stack. Updated weekly.*

---

### 🏗️ Building: Coding Agents

These are implementation starting points, not benchmark rankings or fixed-price quotations.

**I want to build a coding agent for my startup**
→ Start with **Deep Agents** or **OpenHands**, an **E2B/OpenSandbox** execution environment, and **Langfuse** traces; measure success and total model/compute cost on your own repository tasks.

**I want an enterprise coding agent with security controls**
→ Compare **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and **Devin** against your identity, audit, retention, and network requirements; Cursor [Privacy Mode](https://cursor.com/security) prevents training on your data but does not mean all processing stays on your infrastructure.

**I want an open-source self-hosted coding agent**
→ Use **OpenHands** for a software-agent platform, **Cline** for IDE interaction, or **Aider** for terminal/git workflows; check model access, sandbox isolation, and each component license.

**I want a browser automation / web scraping agent**

### 🧠 Model Selection

**I need a model for complex multi-step reasoning**
→ Compare **GPT-6 Astra** and **Claude Fable 5.1** on your own tasks; **Claude Opus 5**, **GPT-5.6 Sol** and **Gemini 3.8 Flash** offer different cost/capability tradeoffs. Check access and the API table before committing a workload.

**I need inexpensive high-volume inference**
→ Evaluate **GPT-5.6 Luna**, **Gemini 3.8 Flash** and **DeepSeek V4-Flash** with realistic output lengths, cache-hit rates and retries. DeepSeek's **peak**, not off-peak, hours are 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC.

**I need Chinese-language agents**
→ Shortlist **Qwen3.8**, **Kimi K3**, **DeepSeek V4**, **GLM-5.3 / GLM-5.3-Flash** and **Seed 2.1**. Test domain terminology and tool schemas; the Chinese comparison table separates hosted access, downloadable weights and custom licenses.

**I have around 16 GB of GPU memory**
→ Start with a supported quantization of **Phi-4** or **Gemma 4 12B**, then measure real memory use. A 35B MoE does not fit because only 3B parameters are active; its full weights and KV cache still need storage.

**I have a larger local workstation or GPU cluster**
→ **Qwen3.8-27B**, **Gemma 4 31B** and **Muse Glimmer 30B** are workstation candidates after quantization. Large MoEs such as **DeepSeek V4**, **GLM-5.3-Flash** and **Inkling** require substantially more aggregate memory or offloading; use the storage table, not active-parameter counts.

**I need a coding model**
→ Use **Claude Sonnet 5** or **GPT-5.6 Sol** as a baseline, then evaluate **GPT-6 Astra**, **Claude Fable 5.1** or **Muse Spark 1.3** on harder tasks. For self-hosting, compare **GLM-5.3**, **GLM-5.3-Flash**, **DeepSeek V4** and smaller **Qwen3.8-27B** under their respective licenses.

**I need multimodal understanding**
→ **Gemini 3.8 Flash** accepts text, images, audio, video and PDFs but outputs text. **Qwen3.8-27B** and **Gemma 4** offer local options; **Inkling** accepts text, images and audio. Confirm the exact model supports your input and output modalities.

**I need at least 500K tokens of context**
→ Compare **GPT-6 Astra**, **Claude Fable 5.1 / Sonnet 5**, **Gemini 3.8 Flash**, **DeepSeek V4** and **Kimi K3**. Context windows include more than user input; account for output, thinking, modality tokens, service limits and long-context surcharges.

**I need real-time voice**
→ For native voice interaction, evaluate **GPT-Realtime-2.1** or **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live**. For a pipeline, choose STT (**Qwen3-ASR**, **Voxtral Realtime**, **Muse Voice Transcribe**) separately from TTS (**Qwen3-TTS**, **Kokoro**, **Eleven v3**).

**I need image generation or editing**
→ Compare **gpt-image-2**, **Nano Banana 2 / Pro**, **Seedream 5.0 Pro** and **FLUX.2** using your reference images and layouts. **Midjourney V8.2 Edit** is alpha; **Stable Diffusion 3.5** offers local weights under its community license.

**I need video generation or editing**
→ Start with **Gemini Omni Flash 1.1** for conversational editing, **Veo 3.1** for frame control/extension, or **Runway Gen-4.5 / Aleph 2.0** for production editing. **Seedance 2.5**, **MiniMax H3** and **LTX-2.5** are additional candidates; compare native clips separately from extended timelines.

**I need MIT or Apache-2.0 model weights**
→ Consider **Qwen3.8-27B**, **Gemma 4**, **Mistral Small 4**, **DeepSeek V4**, **GLM-5.3-Flash** and **Inkling**. Do not transfer those licenses to **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next**, **GLM-5.3**, **Kimi K3**, **MiniMax M3** or **Llama**, which have different terms.

**I need embeddings and reranking**
→ Evaluate **Qwen3-Embedding**, **Qwen3-VL-Embedding**, **Cohere Embed v4**, **Gemini Embedding 2** or **Voyage 4** on your corpus. Use a dedicated reranker for the retrieved candidates; compare recall, latency and total indexing cost rather than mixed leaderboard scores.

**I need document parsing or content moderation**
→ Use specialized interfaces such as **Mistral OCR 4.1** for structured document extraction and **Shieldstral 1.0** for policy classification. Treat their confidence or policy labels as inputs to your workflow, and validate representative failure cases.

---

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

Validate deployment assumptions with the selected components and workload.

**I want to run everything locally**
→ Use **Ollama/llama.cpp**, a local UI, and **Qdrant/pgvector**; verify model, embedding, telemetry, connector, and network settings before asserting that data stays local.

**I want to minimize API costs**
→ Use the current model price table, measure tokens/tool calls/retries, cache stable context, and enforce a budget outside the model; compare cost per successful task rather than input-token price alone.

**I want to scale to enterprise workloads**
→ Choose a managed or self-hosted runtime with explicit quotas, durable state, retries, and observability; load-test your actual concurrency and provider rate limits.

**I want an air-gapped or regulated deployment**
→ Inventory model weights, licenses, package mirrors, telemetry, updates, and connector egress; a self-hosted library alone does not establish an air gap or regulatory compliance.

**I want edge / mobile deployment**
→ Select **Core ML**, **Google AI Edge**, or **llama.cpp** according to the device; benchmark a supported quantized model on-device for memory, battery use, latency, and task quality.

**I need multiple model providers**
→ Use a gateway such as **Bifrost** and keep workflow state in your own database; test tool schemas, streaming, errors, and fallback behavior per provider.

**I want to self-host the full stack**
→ Combine local inference, **Qdrant/pgvector**, **Langfuse**, and an agent framework; size memory for weights, KV cache, context, concurrency, and runtime overhead instead of promising a universal GPU configuration.

---

### 📊 Evaluation & Monitoring

Measure the complete agent workflow and document evaluator limitations.

**I want to evaluate agent output quality**
→ Use **DeepEval**, **LangSmith**, or **Agenta** with representative cases and explicit rubrics; pair judge scores with deterministic checks and sampled human review.

**I want to debug why my agent is failing**
→ Capture tool calls, model requests, latency, errors, and state transitions with **Langfuse** or **Phoenix**; reproduce the failed trajectory before changing prompts or models.

**I want to monitor production agents**
→ Use **OpenTelemetry/OpenInference** with **Langfuse**, **Phoenix**, or **Helicone**; monitor task outcomes, costs, latency, and errors, and redact sensitive trace fields.

**I want to compare models or prompts**
→ Use **Braintrust**, **LangSmith**, or **Agenta** experiments; hold datasets, tools, budgets, and scoring constant, and record exact model snapshots.

**I want to benchmark models on my tasks**
→ Build a held-out set of real cases with expected outcomes; report success, regressions, cost, and latency, and repeat stochastic runs instead of substituting a public leaderboard rank.

**I want to evaluate MCP server security**
→ Use **Snyk Agent Scan** for agent/MCP/skill scanning, then review tool permissions, credential scope, source provenance, and sandbox/network controls; a clean scan is not a security guarantee.

---

### 🌍 Ecosystem Choices

**I want to build within the OpenAI ecosystem**
→ **OpenAI Agents SDK** with **GPT-5.6 Terra** for balanced workloads, **GPT-5.6 Luna** for throughput, or **GPT-6 Astra** for demanding tasks; add a sandbox and evaluation appropriate to the application.

**I want to build within the Anthropic Claude ecosystem**
→ **Claude Code** with **Claude Sonnet 5 / Opus 5 / Fable 5.1**, **MCP** for tool connections, and **Langfuse** for observability; evaluate the model and harness together.

**I want to build within the Google Gemini ecosystem**
→ **Google ADK** with **Gemini 3.8 Flash** or **Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview**, plus Google Cloud deployment and evaluation services; verify the selected endpoint's region and preview status.

**I want to build for the Chinese market**
→ Compare **Qwen3.8**, **Seed 2.1**, **ERNIE 5.1** and **Kimi K3** through the required regional endpoints. Provider choice alone does not establish data residency or regulatory compliance.

**I want a TypeScript-first stack**
→ **Mastra** or **LangChain.js / LangGraph.js**, **Vercel AI SDK**, **Qdrant JS client** and **Langfuse JS SDK** are integration options; check each component's current license and feature support.

**I want a self-hosted stack with permissive model weights**
→ Use a compatible local runtime with **Qwen3.8-27B** or **Gemma 4**, then add **LangGraph**, **Qdrant** and an observability service. Self-host every required component and inspect optional hosted features separately.

## ⚠️ Anti-Picks — What NOT to Use For…

*Engineering tradeoffs to evaluate on your workload; these are not universal benchmark results.*

| ❌ Don’t Use | ❌ For This | ✅ Use Instead | Why |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| LangChain v0.x examples | New production agents | Current LangChain / **LangGraph** documentation | Old APIs and dependency pins need migration and regression checks |
| AutoGPT legacy demos | Unsupervised production work | A maintained runtime with explicit permissions and recovery | A demo does not establish reliability for your workload |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo by habit | New reasoning workloads | A currently supported model tested on your own eval | Compare measured quality, latency and total cost rather than model age alone |
| Pinecone Starter | A requirement to self-host the database | **Qdrant** or **pgvector** | Starter still exists as a free hosted plan; it is not a self-hosted offering ([pricing](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/)) |
| Unvalidated LLM output | Direct financial execution | **Deterministic validation and execution limits** | Generated numbers and actions need independent checks |
| ChatGPT subscription alone | API authentication or API billing | **OpenAI API** project and billing | ChatGPT and API access are separate product surfaces |
| Free shared inference without capacity planning | Sustained production load | Reserved capacity or a measured self-hosted deployment | Quotas, concurrency and cold starts depend on the provider and workload |
| Autonomous agents without qualified review | Medical or legal decisions | A model plus **qualified human review** | Fluent output is not evidence of correctness or suitability |
| Unreviewed remote MCP endpoints | Sensitive documents | A reviewed local or contractually approved processing path | Check actual data flows, retention and access controls; an MCP label guarantees none of them |
| Multi-agent orchestration by default | A simple one-shot task | **Direct model/tool call** | Extra planning and handoffs can add cost and latency without helping |
| Unofficial Midjourney wrappers | A dependency on a supported generation API | A vendor-documented image API | Midjourney's documented web/Discord commands do not establish support for a third-party API ([docs](https://docs.midjourney.com/)) |
| Unmeasured general vision prompts | High-accuracy document OCR | A document OCR pipeline plus a representative evaluation set | Error rates and cost depend on language, layout and scan quality |
| Retired video endpoints | New video applications | A currently available vendor video API | Verify the endpoint, access region and service lifecycle before integrating |
| Vector search without retrieval evaluation | High-precision RAG | Evaluate hybrid search and reranking on your corpus | Reranking gains are dataset-dependent; no universal recall percentage applies |
| A fast model chosen only by price | Complex high-stakes reasoning | Compare capable models with task-specific evaluation and review | A provider tier name is not a reliability guarantee |
| An unreleased model name | Production dependency planning | A model whose **weights or API are available to you** | Verify the official model card and your actual entitlement |
| One leaderboard score | Choosing a coding agent | Multiple benchmarks plus **your own repository eval** | Harnesses, task distributions and test quality differ |
